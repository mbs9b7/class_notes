TEXTBOOK
The Art of Computer Virus Research and Defense by Peter Szor (probably not sold in bookstore)	-actually sounds interesting to read
(also recommended) Grey Hack Python by Justin Seitz

lots of online resources too (in the syllabus)

Who are black hats?
3 types of highly motivated and well organized groups are behind malware creation 
	1) Nation states looking for strategic information and advantage
	2) Organized crime groups looking for profits
	3) terrorist groups looking for political and economic gain

often times organized crime and nation states work hand in hand (for protection)

Read stuff cause it will be on the midterm. just random "fun facts"

Read Szor, pages 23-38 (terminology)
his website is still harrisonwl.github.io

syllabus is up there.

schedule is up and it's in order, but not necessarily correct dates
