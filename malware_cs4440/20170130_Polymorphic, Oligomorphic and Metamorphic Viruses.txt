Polymorphic, Oligomorphic and Metamorphic Viruses 

Polymorphic viruses:
	it's payload has many instances. often generated through mutation or encryption
	why? because if there are a lot of versions of your virus it's harder to detect each and every one

Encrypted viruses:
	virus that comes encrypted and comes with a decrypted part that will decrypt the rest
	downside is decryptor can still be scanned for

Oligomorphic viruses
	have polymorphic decryptors, making it harder to scan for the decryptor
