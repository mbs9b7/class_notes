Grid computing was the precursor to cloud computing. It's basically using compute time when it's not being used. Examples are SETI @ home and Folding @ home. 
Problem is it's not profitable. Started around 2002. Got big around 2005, and eventually evolved into the cloud. 

Infrastructures are rapidly changing and growing

High Performance Computing:
	Homogeneous nodes
	"Speed"
	Parallelism
	"Energy efficient"
	Usually in the same datacenter via MPP

High Throughput Computing:
	Disparate nodes
	"Productivity"
	Work flows
	"Security" -> federated IAM	
	often in many places via P2P connections


High scale problems usually require both HPC and HTC.

HTC is more in the business world and HPC is more in scientific applications.

But once again, you need both to solve "big" problems
