Grid computing was the precursor to cloud computing. It's basically using compute time when it's not being used. Examples are SETI @ home and Folding @ home. 
Problem is it's not profitable. Started around 2002. Got big around 2005, and eventually evolved into the cloud. 

Infrastructures are rapidly changing and growing

High Performance Computing:
	Homogeneous nodes
	"Speed"
	Parallelism
	"Energy efficient"
	Usually in the same datacenter via MPP

High Throughput Computing:
	Disparate nodes
	"Productivity"
	Work flows
	"Security" -> federated IAM	
	often in many places via P2P connections


High scale problems usually require both HPC and HTC.

HTC is more in the business world and HPC is more in scientific applications.

But once again, you need both to solve "big" problems

1 server can be a cloud. Called a private cloud because it runs the same software that runs the distributed cloud, but it's not distributed yet. 

Fog Computing is a cloud brought closer to the user. He called it a mobile cloud. 

Dew computing is next. "in three years I will have a class on Fog and dew computing" -professor

"full function" / unconstrained
	cloud

"reduced function" / constrained
	fog


dew is a combination of fog and cloud working together.
	have any compute, anywhere, be managed by cloud compute resources. 
	current problem: How do you get the data from the edge to the could?
